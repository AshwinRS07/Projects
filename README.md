# Projects
This is where I upload short-term projects I have undertaken while studying new concepts, or simply code samples I made which I am proud of.

1. Movie Reservation:
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to retrieve the completed project with backend integration since this project was for an undergrad course.
However, I have uploaded what I believe is the midterm submission with most of the frontend done. Like most of my projects though, a lot of the work
was done in a crunch near the deadline. I am hopeful of either restoring the full project, or creating another one better than the last completed one!

2. PyGame Tutorial
This is an implementation of Tech With Tim's PyGame tutorial with added functionalities. Link: https://youtu.be/jO6qQDNa2UY?si=nqJjp_5WbiSqSyGz
